**Hello World!** Welcome to my new place on the internet. It's early Feb '24 and after months of procrastinating, today I bought the domain *nordling.xyz* and this is the address I'll use when sharing what's on my mind.

<!--more-->

This is the first blog post I publish in a very long time... Apologize in advance if some of the things doesn't make sense right now.
There are more content in the pipeline and now that my new website is live (yay) I have no excuse for not sharing stories from my life more regularly.

Let's start by looking at the previous month, January.

## Targets for January 🎯

My new year didn't start the way I wanted as I was already behind on my writing projects for December.
My sole target was to *Publish my 2023 Review, by writing 24 minutes each day*.

That project alone involved a lot of big tasks such as acquiring a new domain name, setting up a website, writing the post, mentally get through the stages of impostor syndrome, stop procrastinating and get back to writing, second guessing what I'm allowed to say, and then maybe save my work before I publish.
I'm still not "done" with the several other posts I have started, hence I publish this instead.

## What Actions Did I Take?

🐸 = [Eat the Frog](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/eat-the-frog). *Do Something you have been putting off, hoping it would disappear*.

### Week 1

- Created an account on the Blocket marketplace[^1] and bookmarked several listings with concert and event tickets.
- Postponed my morning workout until 1 PM when Build Series 2[^2] started. My intention is to adjust my workout schedule for these videos.
- 🐸 Responded to Reuben about his guitar amp at Raymont, that I've postponed since May.
- 🐸 Restarted *30 Days to Better Habits*[^3]. It became my Eat the Frog, and I'm glad I pushed through the discomfort and just got it done.
- 🐸 Walked in the snow to the local recycling station to do my part for future generations. Got rid of the plastic and cartons that had been waiting for a few weeks.
- Cleared the driveway of fresh snow in anticipation of mom coming home from work.
- 🐸 Ordered more Magnesium and Zinc supplements.
- Started a new programming project with a Homebrew Cask for Station. I'll probably never use this myself but the knowledge can be applied to other Casks[^4].
- Installed the iOS app *Time Timer* to aid with habit formation such as the 2-minute rule and #Write24in24.
- Researched software for RGB keyboards that's compatible with macOS[^5]. You Windows users are better off here.
- Created a new playlist with music imported from Shazam via *NG Spotify Importer*.

[^1]: Sweden's equivalent to Gumtree and Craigslist.<br />
[^2]: I found Chris & Edi's workout channel in 2023 and did their 6-week Build Series at home.<br />
[^3]: I signed up for this in 2021 when I first started reading Atomic Habits and began taking my habits more seriously. I couldn't keep up with the lessons, then fell off the wagon, and left it for future Ras to deal with.<br />
[^4]: Homebrew Cask is like a helpful assistant for installing and managing software on macOS.<br />
[^5]: My brother gifted me a new keyboard for my birthday and I have been unable to customize the colors on my Mac.

### Week 2

- Installed Pocket Casts in frustration as I wanted to try a different podcast app than Overcast.
- Followed along with the workouts of Build Series 2, week 2.
- Explored the possibilities of [web scraping](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/selenium-python-web-scraping#getting-started) with the scripting language Python and Selenium.
- Ordered an external 27” 4K monitor *Dell 2723QE*.

### Week 3

- Bought my first smart LED lights to add automation and colours to my bedroom ceiling lamp.

### Week 4

- 🐸 Solved the build issues I introduced to my [robot-simulator](https://github.com/HappyStinson/robot-simulator) back in October.
- Continued with *30 Days to Better Habits*.
- Bought SHOEI GT-Air II motorcycle helmet.
- Unpacked my DELL monitor.
- Browsed Blocket for another pair of dumbbells, a MacBook Pro M1, and concert tickets.

### Week 5

- Prepared this post obviously and got ready for great things in February.

## How Did I Feel?

- I became sensitive and shed a tear when grandma was about to leave. Feels like we sense that she doesn't have much time left.
- Slightly under the weather, it was probably mostly fatigue, still managed to work out.
- A little unmotivated to leave the bed, maybe because it's cold?
- Been struggling to mainly fall back asleep after waking up in the middle of the night.
- Still a bit nervous to ask family and friends for favors.

## Gold Stars 🌟

- W1. To Nick who created the [NG Spotify Importer](https://github.com/NBS-LLC/ng-spotify-importer).
- W2. To Web Technologies. I love building and breaking things. 😈
- W3. To Price comparison sites such as PriceRunner. Man I love to bargain.
- W4. To Chris & Edi and their [Power Hour workout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvLHfgLpd0) that I did twice this week.

## Demerits 😫

*A quality or characteristic deserving of blame or censure; a fault.*

- There's a lot to say. That I procrastinated and stayed up late, which led to being groggy and maybe stressed and frustrated.
- Still biting my nails from time to time, when I'm bored or something. Aware of it but continue.
- That I have a hard time asking for help. Stuck at work and wasting time trying to solve it myself.

Until you hear from me again.
