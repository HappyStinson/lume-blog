Hi there, it's been a while since last time!

I'm just advertising a small game that I threw together with Michael Cassel during this year's [BOSS Jam](https://boss.bthstudent.se/bossjam/bossjam-2014/) held in April.
There's a [gameplay video](https://youtu.be/TyWreu4zX1c) of the game uploaded to YouTube.<!--more-->

This post came quite spontaneously and maybe got a little short. It doesn't matter because I have more to write so keep out for more. It will be within the near future ðŸ™‚.

That was all for this time!
