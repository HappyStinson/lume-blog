Hi this is Ras. These are my thoughts and ideas with this website and why I decide to commit to this project again in 2024.

The different starter templates I tried in my pursuit of finding something I liked.

React-based. First looked into Gatsby, then Next, and finally found Deno!

My old website is still [available](https://rasmus-nordling.netlify.app/) until I have migrated everything to its new home.

What worked without issues?

- Generated Favicon from this site. https://favicon.io/
- Used images from https://unsplash.com/s/photos/programming
- Adding [relative URLs](https://lume.land/plugins/relative_urls/).

What problems arose?

- Understanding the site structure and where to make changes.
- Understanding how to change all the SVG animations, add images etc.
- Adding footnotes.
- node_modules ðŸ˜«
- Deploying on Netlify, well not their fault.

What changes to I want to make?

It's good to have a Vision and perhaps also some kind of Definition of Done.
Here are just some things that I believe would make this website even better.

- Add interactivity through [comments](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/add-blog-comments-static-site).
- Embed some small games.
- Use MDX?
- Spotify plugin to show playlists inside my posts.
- Embed interactive Instagram posts.
- Custom 404 page to show you something comforting when the page you wanted disappeared.
