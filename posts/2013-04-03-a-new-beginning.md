Late night reflections of what direction to pursue with my blogging and programming.

Hello all pinecone kids and pine parents!

Here I am in bed listening to Marcy Playground.
Music, Blogging, and Reading just before the Sandman arrives. Hard to top. Oh right, I also have an Easter egg with candy here in bed. Just missing a beer. Well, I'll save that for the weekend.

## Late Night Reflections

To tie in with the title, I'm considering changing the name and focus of the blog. I've kind of veered off into other tracks, and my heart beats for #opensource & #linux (you know that operating system that isn't Windows or macOS).

There's a lack of a place where someone describes with text and images how to do cool things in Linux with just a few characters and a cool compiler. Oh right, I'll definitely include sections on [Makefiles](https://odino.org/makefile-101/), which are so fun. ðŸ˜€

Two name suggestions that spontaneously came to mind are:

1. Happy Linux Coding
2. Open Linux Coding

Well, by now most people have probably fallen asleep, so I'll wrap this up.

Take care and good night!
