Short personal update of where I've been the last year.

Okay, it's time to kickstart again!
Ironically, it's **EXACTLY** one year since I wrote the previous post. Hah!

This will just be a short post since I have more important things to do than writing about game ideas.
I haven't lost the urge to program, it's just been suppressed by everything else that's fun and time-consuming.

Anyway, my recent thoughts have revolved around astrology since I watched the documentary [ZEITGEIST: THE MOVIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qKjijP99c), so a game revolving around horoscopes and analyzing events in society might have been something.

Take Care.
