I tend to get game ideas quite often and now I'm going to develop one of them and document it here!

## 2012 Post

*This post was originally posted on [happy kodar](https://happykodar.blogspot.com/2012/03/new-game-awwww-yeeaahh-i-tend-to-get.html)*.

The project name is *Dansk Mask - reLoaded* and it will expand on mine and Robin's uni assignment *Dansk Mask*. That was a game we made that combined the mechanics of [Snake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFOdT-Nw9XQ) and [Achtung, die Kurve!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T_-QfogpA8). ü™±

The plan so far is:

- ~~Create a Development Blog~~
- Prioritize what Features to include
- Create a diagram with UMLet
- Find libraries to aid with the implementation

## 2024 Update

Well this project never really took off. I remember having build issues with the technology we were using. It was written in C++ and used a custom wrapper around Haaf's Game Engine (HGE).
To my surprise I see there's still a version of [HGE](https://kvakvs.github.io/hge/) being maintained so I might look into getting a version of Dansk Mask working again (given I find our source code after all this time)... Wish me Luck! üçÄ
