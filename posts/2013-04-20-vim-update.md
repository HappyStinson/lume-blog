I discuss a plugin for the Vim text editor, the latest Linux distribution I fell in love with, and a new song I discovered.

There we go, now I've managed to get out of bed and into the shower. It is *Saturday* after all.

> In Scandinavian countries, Saturday is called l√∂rdag, l√∏rdag, or laurdag, the name being derived from the old word laugr/laug (hence Icelandic name Laugardagur), meaning bath, thus L√∂rdag equates to bath-day. This is due to the Viking practice of bathing on Saturdays.

I'm wearing my [ovve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_boilersuit) (student boilersuit), so I'm **REALLY** fancy right now! üôÇ

I'll be off in a while, so right now I'm sitting a bit tilted and eating my box of Italian chicken pasta while grooving to the beats of a really catchy song. Macklemore & Ryan Lewis - Thrift Shop.

It can hardly be anything negative to write a little here before one is going to... well, that's not what I was going to write about.

## Extend Vim with Plugins

To summarize a bit since last time.
I've steered the ship a bit more towards game engine architecture and looked a bit more at plugins for Vim. I'm going to install and test one called [YouCompleteMe](https://ycm-core.github.io/YouCompleteMe/), which is a code completion engine for Vim, and I'll come back with reactions or something about it.

## Fall in Love with CrunchBang üêß

Now I must be on my way, so the last thing I must mention is that I fell a little in love with [CrunchBang Linux](https://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/crunchbang-waldorf.html) (stylized as #!) üòç. It's a Linux distribution like so many others, but I like that it's based on Debian and is very minimalist. Definitely something I'll look more into another time! üòÄ
