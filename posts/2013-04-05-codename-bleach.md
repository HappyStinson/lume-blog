Hej Minikraken!

And a cheerful Hello to all other sweet Humans and Bots reading this.

## Reading about Cross-Platform Development in C++

Yesterday, I was a good fish and read a whole chapter (started with the first one) in the book [Cross-Platform Development in C++: Building Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows Applications](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2311612.Cross_Platform_Development_in_C_). Feels fun somehow when you're reading and suddenly get the urge to own a Mac. Too bad they're quite expensive. ðŸ˜­

Anyway, today I made some notes in my notebook and thought to share them here, what else would one use a notebook for? Or a blog for that matter. ðŸ˜‰

Haven't quite decided what this will turn into but the idea is well, maybe to make games or something. We'll see.

## Yet Another Project

What's with the BLEACH thing?
Bleach is quite simply Nirvana's *debut* album. The world's best band if you ask me.

So, this project will be my "cross-platform *debut*" if you will.
It's also the name I have for my computer, a Sony VAIO with Debian-Linux 7.

A few bullet points are always fun. Mostly my own thoughts so it might be a bit vague.

- Same functionality for Windows, Mac, and Linux
- Common codebase
- Factory for platform-specific code
- C++11 and STL
- Test the code through different compilers and flags. Warnings = Errors.
- Thread-safe Singleton

That'll wrap up today's post. Got to make time for chapter 2 and head-bang some more!
