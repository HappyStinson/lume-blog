Then let's try again. This time I'll *keep* what I've written.

At the moment, I'm listening to Wondrous Bughouse, which is the new album by Youth Lagoon. I looked up my old game ideas and found the line "Indie game about a boy/girl floating on a cloud and listening to chillwave."

I'm really eager to start coding. Finish the exams and spend my free time making music and games. Then, indeed, there will be material to write about and showcase here.

Now Go Listen to Wondrous Bughouse.
