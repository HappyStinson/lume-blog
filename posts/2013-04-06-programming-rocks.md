I share my Excitement for the (at the time) newest C++ standard.

There we go! Saturday and all. The sun is shining, and here I am, tapping away on the keyboard. üë®‚Äçüíª

Apparently, [the King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_XVI_Gustaf) is in town today. Maybe that's why I'm staying indoors, haha!

But onto something more serious. I was planning to familiarize myself with the new standard for C++, C++11.
It was quite fortunate that I stumbled upon the [C++ Rocks!](https://cpprocks.com/) website, which seems to be really great.

There were two articles in particular that caught my interest. One about the build tool CMake and the other about compilers. Feels really promising at first glance. I'll have to look into this more now!

Enjoy the spring sun. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Perhaps I'll end all my posts with a cute picture? Here you go!
