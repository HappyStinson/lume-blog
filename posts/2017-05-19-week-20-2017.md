Hi,

I know it's been a long time. I haven't been at my best these last couple of months and had to prioritize the things that's more important.

Anyway the aim with this blog is to challenge the world and myself, go outside of my comfort zone and achieve those big life goals that I have (and you hopefully have yours).

## Travel

I spent the weekend in Berlin on my very first Knowabunga with [tretton37](https://tretton37.com/). It was nice to get together and meet colleges from the other offices. Before we flew back to Sweden I took the U-Bahn to Alexanderplatz and went up the[_Fernsehturm_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernsehturm_Berlin)맚o get a 360 view of the city. 游뗵

## Tobacco Endgame

Attended two seminars about tobacco and alcohol and got further knowledge in how it prevents맙ustainable development, globally.
The world would be better of without these industries and their "products".
I later pitched my idea to a few people about a podcast discussing tobacco politics and I got good response.
After more investigation at [The Audacity to Podcast](https://theaudacitytopodcast.com/getting-started/)I realized there's more work before the launch (it will hopefully be before the[World No Tobacco Day, 31 May](https://www.who.int/tobacco/wntd/en/)).
For news and articles about tobacco restriction I would point you in the direction of [Tobaksfakta](https://tobaksfakta.se/kategori/english/).

Approached a few smokers at the subway station and on the street. We briefly discussed their habit. One guy was from Syria and he thought I asked for a smoke.
It was difficult sitting next to him and inhale the poisonous smoke but he turned out to be nice. Even if they chose to continue smoking I got a confidence boost and will continue to hand out information to those who want help saying NO to Tobacco!

I spent some time on Facebook actively promoting the*World No Tobacco Day, 31 May*.

## Running

Yesterday evening was MilSp친ret at Djurg친rden and this time I really pushed for a personal best (and got it).
Distance 10K and final time was 50:34 minutes, giving a pace of 5:03 min/km. That's an improvement by 1 minute and 38 seconds. I still chase sub 50 though.
It was really hot running in the sun and I had my new clothes that shows I support Swedish Running.

Next up, ASICS Stockholm Marathon which is happening June 3!

## The Bad News

It's time to finish this post with some bad news. This week I have been biting on my fingernails like a mad man so that habit I still haven't managed to quit.

This was just a recap of my week so far. Stay tuned for more in depth content about my other adventures and discoveries.

Take care!
